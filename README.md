# B.Sc_Final_Project_WiFi_AC_Remote

Abstract

The main idea behind this project is to make our home smarter. That means that every element we have can be connected to an app and can be controlled from distance using the internet. This project starts with the AC, because it contains sending an IR codes and using database and much more complex than just turn switch on or off, but the idea is to continue and make all elements at home able to connect to the internet and therefore be controlled with a smartphone app from anywhere around the world.
